## 3.3. Impact Mapping.

En este documento se presenta un Impact Map que refleja cómo las funcionalidades y acciones del sistema IoT de gestión de insumos para restaurantes cumplen con los objetivos de negocio definidos. 
Este mapa establece una clara relación entre los objetivos comerciales, los actores involucrados, los impactos que generan, y los entregables necesarios para lograr esos objetivos.

El proyecto está segmentado en dos tipos principales de usuarios: dueños de restaurantes y personal de cocina, cada uno con sus propias necesidades y responsabilidades dentro del sistema. 
A continuación, se detalla el Impact Map correspondiente para cada segmento.
