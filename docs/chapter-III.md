## 3.3. Impact Mapping.

En este documento se presenta un Impact Map que refleja cómo las funcionalidades y acciones del sistema IoT de gestión de insumos para restaurantes cumplen con los objetivos de negocio definidos. 
Este mapa establece una clara relación entre los objetivos comerciales, los actores involucrados, los impactos que generan, y los entregables necesarios para lograr esos objetivos.

El proyecto está segmentado en dos tipos principales de usuarios: dueños de restaurantes y personal de cocina, cada uno con sus propias necesidades y responsabilidades dentro del sistema. 
A continuación, se detalla el Impact Map correspondiente para cada segmento.

### Dueño de Restaurante
<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/ImpactDueño.png" />
</p>
Este Impact Mapping ilustra cómo las funcionalidades del sistema ayudan a José Ramírez a mejorar la gestión operativa de su restaurante. Al proporcionarle una página de aterrizaje clara y opciones de contacto fácil, facilita su decisión de suscribirse y usar la plataforma para optimizar el manejo de insumos y reducir los desperdicios. Además, el monitoreo en tiempo real y las alertas automáticas permiten a José mantener un control eficiente sobre los insumos, lo que contribuye a la reducción de costos y al aumento de la eficiencia del personal.

### Personal de Cocina
<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/ImpactPersonal.png" />
</p>
El Impact Mapping para Mariana Torres muestra cómo el sistema la asiste en la gestión diaria de la cocina al proporcionar monitoreo en tiempo real de las condiciones de los insumos y la capacidad de realizar ajustes sobre la marcha. Esto no solo ayuda a Mariana a manejar eficazmente los insumos, sino que también facilita una planificación más precisa y una respuesta rápida a cualquier problema de suministro, lo que a su vez ayuda a mejorar la eficiencia general del personal de cocina.
